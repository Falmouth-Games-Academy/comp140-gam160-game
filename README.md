# Poolio

Poolio will literally put the pool cue in your hands. Using a cradle to rest your actual physical cue into, the arduino will track it's movements to reflect your shots direction and power. 

## Mechanics

An inbuilt joystick will allow aiming your shot without having to leave the controller but it is in the way that you perform a shot that the game comes into it's own. 
The arduino will track the movement of the cue to trigger a shot and reflect the appropriate amount of force applied.  By angling the cue up and down, screw or top spin may be applied to the object ball, whilst left and right adjustments may be used to replicate adding swerve or to fine tune aiming.

The game itself will be relatively simple and well established; A physics based ball rolling game leaving most of the mechanics to Unreal Engines own physics module. The rules will initially be English pool rules but the amount of variations available leave much scope for games such as snooker, 8 ball, or killer.
