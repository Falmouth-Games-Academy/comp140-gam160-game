# Proposed game ideas
## Proposal 1: Rubber Duck Rhythm Game
### Concept
Music game about ducks where you match the rhythm by mashing rubber ducks. The ducks squeak in response.

### Quirks
* Ducks are tuned to harmonise with the song
* Use the Duck Lemonade song
* Any way to tune the ducks in real-time using moving parts/water?

### Prerequisites
**Art:** Duck face, backgrounds?
**Music:** 1 soundtrack
**Code:** Main game loop, music player, synchronisation, duck sensors, duck lights?
**Extra:** Rhythm *level editor*

## Proposal 2: Artsy Paper Doll game

## Proposal 3: Police car game
# Concept
You drive a police car. The crooks are on the run! Flip on the sirens and lights and drive your car using tilt controls. A music element would be fun...?
