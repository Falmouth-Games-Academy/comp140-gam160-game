# End of the Line

### Description
I have intended this game to be top-down and one that has a similar concept and mechanics portrayed in the Tron movies, where the player's objective is to avoid crashing into the enemy's trail they leave behind from their constantly-moving object. The player also wins by doing this against the enemy. 

### Mechanics
* Fast-paced movement: Dodge and avoid your enemy's trail while using the various contraptions spread around the environment to your advantage, such as ramps, barriers, etc.
