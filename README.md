### Description (wip)
This game is intended to have a similar concept and mechanics shown in the Tron movies, where the player's objective is to avoid crashing into the enemy's trail they leave behind from their constantly-moving object. The player also wins by doing this against the enemy. 

### Mechanics (wip)
* Fast-paced movement: Dodge and avoid crashing behind your enemy's trail using the various contraptions spread around the environment to your advantage, such as ramps, barriers, etc.
