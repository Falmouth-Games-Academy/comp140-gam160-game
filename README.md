Repository for Assignment 1 of COMP140-GAM160

In my game, you will take up the role of a submarine commander. There will be a continual list of commands for the player to fulfil, to gain points the player must complete the tasks correctly. However, if the player presses the wrong button of list of buttons, they will lose a life. When they lose all their lives the game ends as the submarine would have sunk. The game increases in difficulty after each successful completion of a command. As the difficulty increases the time between each command decreases. This aims to increase the stress level of the player, making them more likely to make mistakes and lose lives.

The controller I will be making in tandem shall link directly to my game. I plan to make the controller incorporate things like variable resistors, whereby the game will ask the player to set something to a certain value and they must set the potentiometers to that value. I will also be incorporating toggle switches to complete ‘activate’ and ‘Turn On’ commands. I have chosen toggle switches as I feel they make the controller feel more like it is part of a submarine command panel. I will also be trying to have red LEDs that light up when a certain switch or potentiometer needs using.
