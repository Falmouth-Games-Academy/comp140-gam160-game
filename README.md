# Overview
My game idea came from both my love of wave based suvival games and my hatred of cats. Basically you will move around a relativley large arena while dozens of cats run at you. The game will be top down with maybe a 3d element to it and very bloody. The players score will be based on time survived and cats killed. If you've ever played box heads its similar to that. I also might add a feature to change the enemy models from cats to other things people don't like, or that don't like people.

# Mechanics
      Dozens of cats chasing the player
      Player dies if cats hit him 3 or 5 times
      Start with a basic pistol
      New guns spawn in the area and other power ups
      Score increases a set amount per second survived as well as extra score per cat annihilated 

# Controller
I want to make this game very hard, and as such I think the players hand should always be on the controller or they won't shoot (there is no actual fire button but the player shoots constantly while the controller is held). So i will need a method of making sure there hand is on the controller. As for movement I'm not quite sure yet, as simple d-pad wouldn't be very creative, but movement by a movement sensor for example could be too hard. Maybe there's a reletivley cheap touch pad I can use similar to a d-pad.
