# GAM160 Proposal for Game With an Alt Controller
###### Repository for Assignment 1 of COMP140-GAM160

## Human Planes

### The Game
Arcade Air plane stunt game. Fly in and around the Death ~~Star~~Moon surving for as long as possible.

### The Core Mechanics
The player will have to dodge incoming fire from turrets and enemy fighter jets. The player is equiped with laser cannons.
When a turret or enemy fighter jet is destroid, there is chance for them to drop "Weapon Parts". These Weapon Parts will randomise the stats of the players laser cannons, such as rate of fire, damage and bullet speed.

## The Controller
Wings will be attached to the players arms. An accelemeromator/gyroscope will be on the tips of the wings to messure rotation of the wings. There will also be buttons on the handles of the wings to fire the laser cannons.

To fly the plane the player just needs to stand in a manor that resembles a plane and the plane will automatically fly forwards. To turn left and right the player tilts their arms up and down (like a plane would). To pitch up and down, the player rotates theirs arms in the same direction (both rotate forward to pitch down, backward to pitch up). If the player rotates their arms in different directions, they will do a barrel role!

## Research
I want to know how I could detect the rotation of the wings so I will look into how other alt. controllers detect rotation and postion of loose or free flowing objects i.e arms.
I will want to know how I could make the player feel like they **are** the plane. So I might look into how other alt. controls use body parts as the controler and how they are atached.

# Previous Ideas

## Cannon Defence - Dan Jones

Cannon Defence is a game where the player defends the castle from waves of invaders. The invaders are attempting to kidnap the people of the castle. The aim of the game is to see how long you can last before everyone has been kidnapped.

**Core Mechanics**
#### Operating the cannon

1. The player loads the the cannon useing a _"Rammer"_. 
2. Next the player positions the cannon rotating it left/right and up/down.
3. Finally the player fires the cannon.

#### Win/Defeat Condition
The game is wave based, each wave is complete when all enamies have been defeated. The player is defeated when all villagers have been kidnapped or are dead.

#### Aditional Mechanics

The player may choose from a veriaty of cannon balls each with different properties.
Each round the player is has a set amount of ammo and different cannon balls use different amounts. 

Type | Name | Properties | Ammo Needed
--- | --- | --- | ---
AOE | Standard | High Damage, Low Impact Raduis | 0
AOE | Explosive | High Damage, High Impact Raduis, High Push Force | 10
AOE | Freeze | Low Damage, Large Impact Raduis, Freezes | 10
AOE | Poison | Low Damage over time, Meduim Impact Raduis | 5
Direct Hit | Snipe | Fast Travel time, hold ten shots before needing to reload, High Damage | 5
Direct Hit | Scatter | Lots of small balls cover wide area, Meduim Damage | 5
Direct Hit | Infection | Enemy turns on its allies infecting others, short life span | 10
Magic | Lightning | Summons Lightning On every enemy dealing Very High Damage | 30
Magic | Deaths Howl | Causes all enamies to cowering in fear for several seconds | 20

When an invader kidnaps a someone, they run back to the forrest. The player has a chance to kill the invader and the villager has a chance to run back to the castle. They will be two options that can make the game harder.
1. Friendly Fire - All cannon balls and magic will have the same effects on the Villager.
2. Not Safe Yet - Invaders can pick up Villagers that are running back to the castle.

## Backup Idea

### Flappy Human

Flappy Human is a silly game where the player weres a pair of wings and flaps their arms to fly around.

With this base idea I can have different gamemodes to choose from for example, flying through rings, cearfully flying through a deadly forrest dodging predators or hunting prey, or the classic flappy bird clone.
