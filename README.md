For my project I plan on making a game that requires the player to follow commands on screen by using certain aspects of the controller, such as flick switches, buttons and twist dials, to keep a submarine functional. There will be a continual list of cammands for the player to fullfil, each with a timer, if the timer runs out without the player conpleting the action/actions stated then the submarine loses structural integrity, when it's structural integrity reaches zero the player loses.
