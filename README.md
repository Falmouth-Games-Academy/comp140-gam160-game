The game im going to make is called " Memory Puzzle " 

The game will be simple, but fun/addictive. You will have 30 overturned squares on your screen and few of them will turn around for a second in a certain order. You will have controller that looks similar to launchpad ( https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818m%2Bo7HoDL._SL1500_.jpg ). On the launchpad you will have same amount of squares that are in game and you will have to press in the squares in the same order that was shown in the game. If you mess up the order of squares you will lose one life ( you will have three lifes in total ). In my opinion this game could be fun to play while you have nothing to do, also it might help to improve your memory.

Controller would be simple, 30 squares and thats it. Each square would be connected to the square in game in the same position.
