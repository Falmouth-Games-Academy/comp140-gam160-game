# End of the Line

### Description
I have intended this game to be top-down and one that has a similar concept and mechanics portrayed in the Tron movies, where the player's objective is to avoid crashing into the enemy's trail they leave behind from their constantly-moving object. The player also wins by doing this against the enemy. 

### Mechanics
* Fast-paced movement: The player is constantly on edge. You move forward with great speed while navigating either left, right or downwards, strategising your next move against your enemy. 

* Environmental hazards: Dodge and avoid your enemy's trail while using the various contraptions spread around the environment to your advantage, such as ramps, barriers, etc.

### Controller
* Sphere shaped controller (almost "crystalball"-like) where the player simply has to rotate the ball to move around in the game, which is something that also fits the game's overall theme. 

#### Things to work on: 
- The general theme of the game. Something other than "Tron" would benefit this game to avoid unoriginality.  
- An appropriate controller style that fits this type of game.
