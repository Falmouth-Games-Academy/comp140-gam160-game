# Car jacking simulator 2017
**Gameplay**
The game is about stealing cars, you are a lowly thief that is being hired to steal cars, the progression would involve stealing better and better cars with harder to crack security.
The adruino controller would be used to break into the car, start the car and disable alarms. If you connect the wrong wires you would be electrocuted or an alarm would go off depending on the car thus ending the level. The levels would get harder by introducing more wires or by hiding the names of wires so that the player would have to find the correct wires through process of elimination. Cutting the wrong wires would varie what happens in the game you could cut the wires and the wipers go off, or the horn beeps.
**Controller**
The controller will be using the basic adruino bread board and the 6 colors of wires provided as buttons(When you touch two wires together). Two wires generated by random would execute a piece of code which would act as a button input.
