# Game and controller Proposal

## Story
Command a small advanced space cruiser on it's journey to fight against the growing legion of space pirates in Galaxy Omega 3B.

## Gameplay
The game will be a vertical space shoot 'em up bullet hell type of game, like games such as Battle Garegga, Galaga and Rayforce.

## Controller
The ship will be controlled with a 3D printed physical model of the ship as a kind of joystick, so you could tilt it fowards, left right and back to move the ship ingame accordingly. The 3D modeled ship could have some buttons on it for the user to press to shoot. It could also have smaller control panel next to it to indicate ship status and have some extra input components for extra functionalties that might not be able to fit on the ship.

## Potential Stretch Goals
- different types of enemies
- boss fights
- special attacks for the player to use
- upgrades for the player's ship
