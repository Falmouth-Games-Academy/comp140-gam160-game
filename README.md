# Alternative Controller Game Concept

## Game:
The game I want to make will be a 2D puzzle/puzzle platformer that is created in a 3D world, taking insparation from games such as [Fex] (http://fezgame.com/), the character will be controlled by the player in a familliar fashion to 'regular' games such as using either WASD, arrow keys, or even a joystick. However whilst doing this the player will also have to control the world in order to complete the puzzles, This will be done by rotating the alternative controller in a similar fashion to how a rubiks cube works (See gif below)

When a player moves one part of the alternative controller the world in the game will rotate simultaniously and this will be used to locate the character through the level by moving platforms, that were just out of reach, close to the character so that they can progress through the level. The player will have to move the world carfully as they can quickly cause chaos in the world if they're not paying attention to where they are moving traps to and are making fall due to gravity. The game will also feature a timer and a minimal moves scoring system that will allow player's to compete with one another to get the biggest score and fastest times whilst also causing minimal chaos in the world. The player should also be able to rotate the physical controller and the world in the game will rotate with it allowing the player to view all sides of the world before rotating so they know exactly how the world will change once they have rotated it.   


## Controller Design:

For the controller I am going to use 360Â° rotary encoders that will be attached to the middle block of each face of the cube, this will allow me to know when each face of the cube is rotated and can keep track of each block based on the rotation of each encoder. I will also try to use something that will keep the orientation of the cube so I can keep track of how the player is holding it and can change the games view so the player can see each side of the world.
