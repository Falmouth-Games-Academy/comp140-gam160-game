# Game and controller Proposal

## Story
Command a small advanced space cruiser on it's journey to fight against the growing legion of space pirates in Galaxy Omega 3B.

## Gameplay
The game will be a vertical space shoot 'em up bullet hell type of game, like games such as Battle Garegga, Galaga and Rayforce.
The main aim of the game is to survive waves of enemy space ships for as long as possible.

## Controller
The ship will be controlled with a 3D printed physical model of the ship as a kind of joystick, so you could tilt it fowards, left right and back to move the ship ingame accordingly. The 3D modeled ship would have some buttons on it for the user to press to shoot the guns of the ingame spacship. It would also have smaller control panel next to it to indicate ship status such as ship health and have some extra input components for extra functionalties that might not be able to fit on the ship model.
The 3D printted model of the ship will need to be well designed to be fun and comfortable to use, with easy access to buttons and switches. 

### components that could be used for making the controller
- Spacship tilt mechanism could use a classic arcade joystick or potetnially a accelerometer.
- Gun shooting buttons could be momentary pushbuttons.
- the control panel could have some LEDs indicating ship status.
- the control panel could have some switches for activating a thruster boost or shields.

## Potential Stretch Goals
- different types of enemies
- boss fights
- special attacks for the player to use
- upgrades for the player's ship
