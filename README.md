# End of the Line

### Description
I have intended this game to be top-down with local multiplayer. The concept and mechanics are similar to the ones portrayed in the Tron movies, where the player's objective is to avoid crashing into the enemy's (second player's) trail they leave behind from their constantly moving object. The classic game "Snake" is another great example, although with two players instead of one.

### Mechanics
* Fast-paced movement: The player is constantly on edge. You move forward with great speed while navigating left, right, up and down, strategising your next move against your enemy. 

* Environmental hazards: Dodge and avoid your enemy's (second player's) trail while using the various contraptions spread around the environment to your advantage, such as ramps, barriers, etc.

### Controller
* Sphere shaped controller (almost crystal ball-like) where the player simply rotates the ball to move around, which is something that also fits the game's overall theme. Attached image below for clarity.

### Research
From my research, I have not found any controllers that are specifically similar to mine or ones that are linked to any sphere-based games. Although, I have found a fairly similar controller that was designed for Wii Sports by Nintendo, the [Wii Bowling Ball](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/detail-page/B002GEA4U4.2.large.jpg). It was more of a gimmick where you would mimic actual bowling sessions. Another one I found was [Puyocon](http://gizmodo.com/5446278/control-your-pc-with-the-puyocon-motion-sensing-ball), a motion-sensing ball that works on computers. Out of these two, my controller version is simplified, although I think is one with potential if configured properly.
