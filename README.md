## Game Proposal - Joshua Lewis
For this project I intend to produce a sensory game entirely guided by the feeling of touch.
The Player is situated in a maze and has to work their way out without being able to see.

The controller for this project consists of two vibrating motors situated on either side of the body and two buttons for movement.
The motors vibrate when the player is in the proximity of a wall; the left motor vibrates when there is a wall to the left
and the right when a wall is on the right. Both motors vibrate if the wall is ahead.

The player controls the character by pressing the two buttons provided. Left button to go left, right to go right and both to move forward.

This concept both provides a challenge to most people, who often rely on their sight for navigation, and inclusivity to the visually
impared who often cannot play video games due to their disability.

I have produced a simple diagram showing how the components will connect to the arduino
