Repository for Assignment 1 of COMP140-GAM160

## The Concept:
This unnamed game I intend to make will be 3D wave-based defence game where you play as an immobile wizard who is defending himself against enemies such as goblins and imps. The wizard casts spells to fight off the enemies and each enemy will have a weakness to a certain spell. The game will have no win state however it will have a score board which displays the round you got to and the players score. 
## Core Mechanics:
#### Movement: 
The wizard will be immobile in the middle of the map and can only rotate to fight off the enemies coming from every direction.
#### Combat:
The wizard has a set amount of health. The only way to regain health is to get through a round. The game will be over once the wizard loses all his health.
The wizard will be able to cast spells using the alt-controller.  Each spell is an element such as water, fire and earth. Combining these can make more powerful spells. Fire and water makes steam for example. I have taken inspiration from Magicka [1]:(http://arrowheadgamestudios.com/games/magicka/). Each spell will do more damage depending how long you charge it for.
Each enemy will have a weakness and a strength to an element. If it’s a weakness it does extra damage and gives the player a better score for using that spell against that enemy. If it’s a strength, it gives a boost to the enemy and the player loses points.
Each enemy will have set stats such as the speed of them, the health they have and how much damage they do. The round will end when all the enemies have been defeated. After each round, the enemies will get slightly stronger.
#### Alternate Controller:
I am hoping to use a glove in which the player can use hand gestures for spells and move their hand side to side to rotate the wizard. Holding the glove towards the body will charge the spell and a swift motion down will cast it.
